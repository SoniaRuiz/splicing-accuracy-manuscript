## Repository 
The 'splicing-accuracy-manuscript' repository contains the code used to generate all the analyses and figures produced for the manuscript [**Splicing accuracy varies across human introns, tissues and age**](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.29.534370).

### 1. *'manuscript_figures.R'*
To produce the main and supplementary figures and tables using the *'Splicing'* database, supplied for the manuscript *"Splicing accuracy varies across introns, tissues, age and disease"*.

### 2. *'manuscript_ageing_figures.R'*
Produces the main and supplementary figures and tables using the *'Age Stratification'* database, supplied for the manuscript *"Splicing accuracy varies across introns, tissues, age and disease"*.

### 3. *'manuscript_AD_figures.R'*
Produces the main and supplementary figures and tables using the *'AD - control'* SQLITE database (recount3 ID  = SRP100948), supplied for the manuscript *"Splicing accuracy varies across introns, tissues, age and disease"*. 

### 4. *'manuscript_ENCODE_figures.R'*
Produces the main and supplementary figures and tables using the *'ENCODE shRNA'* SQLITE database, supplied for the manuscript *"Splicing accuracy varies across introns, tissues, age and disease"*.

## Supplementary Tables
All supplementary tables can be accessed through Zenodo using the DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.7732872](https://zenodo.org/record/7732872)

## Databases
All SQLite databases used in the *'Splicing accuracy varies across human introns, tissues, age and disease'* paper, can be freely downloaded from [this website](https://rytenlab.com/browser/app/splicing_accuracy_manuscript_databases).
